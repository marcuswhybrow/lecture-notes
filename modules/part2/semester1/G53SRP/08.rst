08 - RTSJ Support for Scheduling and Deadlines
==============================================

Checking and Settings the Scheduler
===================================

::

    package javax.realtime;
    
    public abstract class Schedule
    {
        public static Scheduler getDefaultScheduler();
        public static void setDefaultScheduler();
    }

The Priority-Based Scheduler
============================

Only standard scheduler specified in RTSJ and used as the initial default scheduler.

Schedules realtime threads according to priority where a single fixed priority is assigned to each thread. A higher priority thread that becomes runnable immediately pre-empts a lower priority.

Equal priority threads are not time sliced but may yield to other threads of the same priority.

Schedulable Properties
======================

``SchedulingParameter`` is scheduler-specific thread information (for example priority.)
