06 - Introduction to Real Time Scheduling

Real Time ...
=============

A real-time system is any information processing system which has to respond to externally generated input stimuli within a finite and specified period. The correctness depends not only on the logical result but also the time it was delivered.

Specifying Timing Constraints: Temporal Scopes
==============================================

For a section of code (a "process", "task", "scope" or Java runnable) specify:

* When it should (nominally) start
* When it must be completed by

::

    class Foo implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            
        }
    }

Specifying the System
=====================

We nee to decompose the problem into a fixed set of tasks. Each will be implemented as a thread or some other schedulable thing.

For each task:

* Specify when it should be started. For example periodic (repeated or on a timer) or triggered by some other external event (such as an interrupt).
* Specify the deadline within e
