06 - Introduction to Real Time Scheduling
=========================================

Real Time ...
=============

A real-time system is any information processing system which has to respond to externally generated input stimuli within a finite and specified period. The correctness depends not only on the logical result but also the time it was delivered.

Specifying Timing Constraints: Temporal Scopes
==============================================

For a section of code (a "process", "task", "scope" or Java runnable) specify:

* When it should (nominally) start
* When it must be completed by

Specifying the System
=====================

We need to decompose the problem into a fixed set of tasks. Each will be implemented as a thread or some other schedulable thing.

For each task:

* Specify when it should be started. For example periodic (repeated or on a timer) or triggered by some other external event (such as an interrupt).
* Specify the deadline within which it should finish.

Then arrange for the system to run those tasks at the correct times and in the right order.

Overview of Realtime
====================

There are multiple concurrent process which run either periodically via a sleep or delay process or start sporadically via external events. Both types have deadlines.

Everything in the system is correct if periodic processes are run at the correct rate and all deadline are met.

The scheduler must make processes runnable at the defined times and in the correct order.

Priorities
==========

So in what order should the tasks be executed?

#. Decide a general strategy (e.g. fixed priority scheduling)

    Assign a priority to each process in advance and always run the highest-priority runnable process.
    
#. Assign priorities to each process (e.g. shortest deadline first)

    Also known as *Deadline Monotonic Priority Ordering* (DMPO). This method can be shown to be optimal. In other words if any strategy works then this one will.
