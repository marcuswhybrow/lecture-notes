02 - Perceptron
===============

Over the next few lectures we will study different methods of machine learning.

Perceptron Basic
================

A Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network or ANN. It computes the sum of its weighted inputs and passes the result to a hard-limit threshold function.

It was designed to represent a single neurone in the brain. No one can be sure what exactly a neurone does but this method has some nice properties anyway.

Perceptron Operation
====================

A perceptron ACC accepts an input vector (list of numbers) of ``n`` size and their weights and also a bias number and calculates a linear combination of these inputs and outputs either a 1 or a -1.

First a **weighted sum** is created which is the sum of all the inputs (:math:`x_i`) multiplied by their weights (:math:`w_i`) plus an additional bias weight (:math:`w_0`):

.. math:: w_{0} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}x_{i}

Then the weighted sum is passed through a threshold and ether is outputted as 1 or -1.
