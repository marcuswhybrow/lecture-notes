18 - Hardware Interfacing
=========================

Buses
=====

A bus is a *common set of electrical connections*. It is a standard interface for:

* Control signals
* Address Signals
* Data signals

It works using a standard protocol:

* Read cycle
* Write cycle
* Interrupt cycle (see notes on device programming)

Device Registers
================

Registers are integrated into the architecture of a device by making them look like normal memory:

* Status registers (read)
* Control registers (write)
* Data buffer registers (read/write)

I/O Instructions
================

Memory mapped:

* The bus is the same physically & logically
* Normal read-write instructions

Separate I/O space

* Separate physical or logical bus
* Dedicated I/O instructions
