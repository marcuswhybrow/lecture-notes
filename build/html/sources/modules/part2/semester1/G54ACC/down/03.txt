Modulation(Reprise)
===================

Things you should know.

Amplitude Modulation
    Change the height of the carrier wave to represent the signal.

Frequency Modulation
    Change the frequency of the carrier wave to represent the signal.

Phase Shift Modulation
    Shift the carrier wave certain fractions of a complete wave to represent the signal.

Amplitude and Phase Modulation

*...*

Coherent Detection
==================

Amplitude modulation can be detected/received by simply averaging the signal.

Some know as a Cat's whisker device or crystal radio set were very simple and used just a capacitor and a diode.

Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
===============================

This is the combination of using phase shift keying and adding in amplitude (wave height) as an addition variable. Having 2 levels of amplitude available means another bit of data which can be transmitted in the same section.

Constellations
==============

constellations are way in which you can visualise the different QAM schemes. QAM64 can transfer 64 bits in a single section and was used to enable high speed modems. Modern digital television uses QAM256 which can transfer 256 bits by using a combination of various amounts of shits and differing levels of amplitude.

Telephones
==========

The telephone network was designed to carry voices, which is anything from 0 to 5000 Hz. The digital telephone network starts by digitising the voice signal. But since Nyquist's theorem means we must *bandlimit* to < 4Hz if we have only 8 Hz to transmit in, some of the higher end frequencies of the voice it cut off.

33.6l Modem
===========

When people said we want to provide internet access over these telephone networks there was only these 8Hz to transmit data over. Thus QAM was used it transmit lots of bits over this small frequency.

Recovering the Bits
===================

So far we have looked at schemes to send a series of bits.

* Phase receivers must learn the phase
* Amplitude receivers must deal with attenuation
* QAM must deal with both phase and attenuation

If you sent all zero bits all the time (or all ones), using QAM to carry those bits the carrier wave would just be the same all the time never changing.

So we need to ensure that the bits change sometimes even when the data to be sent **is** all ones or zeros.

Coding - Scramblers
===================

The technique adopted was called a scrambler. It's a pseudo-random bit sequence. The scrambler is XORed with the bit stream and the the same happens on the other end in order to decode it.

Widely used in digital phone networks.

Coding - Block Codes
====================

Maps a bit or bits to be transmitted to more bits. For example *Manchester encoding* or *1b2* would send 01 if you want to send a 0 and 10 if you want to send a 1. This was used for 10Mbps Ethernet.

But this meant twice as many bits, so *4b5* was introduces which has 16 symbols and 32 code words. Used by 100Mbps Ethernet.

*3b10b* 256 symbols with 1024 code words, used for Gigabit Ethernet, PCIExpress, Serial ATA, USB 3.0 DVB, DVI, HDMI, DAT, ...

Finally *64b44b* is actually a scrambler with a 2 bit preamble. Used with 10GigE and actually nearly everything 10G.
